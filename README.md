# 🧑‍💻 Git Collaboration Challenge – Collaborators

In this activity, you’ll practise how developers collaborate on GitHub **when being added as collaborators** — just like in a real company!

You’ll learn how to:
- **Create a new branch**
- **Commit and push changes**
- **Open a Pull Request** 
- **Merge PR into main branch** 
---

## 🌟 Your task
We’re building a simple **“Team Page”** together!  
Everyone will add **their own name** to a shared list in the `index.html` file.

---

## 🧭 Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Breath 🧘🏼‍♀️

---

### 2. Clone the repo
Now, clone the repo to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/Technigo/fall25-github-branches-practice.git
```
Then move into the project folder:

```
cd fall25-github-branches-practice
```

---

### 3. Create a new branch
Create a new branch for your changes — never work directly on main!

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

---

### 4. Make your change
Open the index.html file in your code editor and add your name inside the list.

Example:
```
<ul>
  <li>Matilda Brunemalm</li>
  <li>Jennie Dalgren</li>
  <li>Your Name Here ✨</li>
</ul>
```

---

### 5. Add, commit and push your changes
Make sure to push to your branch!

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added my name to the list"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

---

### 6. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the repo on GitHub.

You’ll see a banner suggesting: “Compare & pull request” – click it.

If not, click on the branch tab and finde your brnach in the list of branches.
Click the three dots to the right of your branch row -> New pull request

Add a title and short description for your PR.

Click Create pull request 🎉

💡 You just asked to merge your changes into the main branch! DO NOT merge yet.

---

### 7. Wait for review and merge
Your teacher/team will review and merge your PR into the main branch.
Once merged, your name becomes part of the project!

checkout the main branch, do a git pull and see your changes in the main branch.
